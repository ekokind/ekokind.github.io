# HCI Course Design - Instructional and Curriculum Design Artifact

## Document Summary
This artifact is a microteaching lesson design for a course titled "Introduction to Human Computer Interaction". This is an upper-level undergraduate computer sciece, information technology, or human centered computing course. It includes course information, detailed lesson planning, learning objectives, assessments, and grading rubrics for a lesson on "Design and Interaction Principles."

### Instructional Design Skills Demonstrated
- **Bloom's Taxonomy Application**: Scaffolds from Remembering â†’ Applying â†’ Evaluating â†’ Creating
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Each objective uses specific, observable verbs (state, label, critique, conceptualize)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from basic recall to complex prototype creation

##### **Assessment Design**
- **Constructive Alignment**: Assessment maps to specific learning objectives
- **Formative Assessment Strategy**: Multiple low-stakes quizzes provide feedback before summative assessment
- **Authentic Assessment**: Real-world scenario (designing for client "Sarah") with practical constraints 
- **Clear Rubrics**: Detailed grading criteria with point allocations and performance levels

##### **Active Learning Integration**
- **Experiential Learning**: Students experience poor design firsthand through [userinyerface.com](https://userinyerface.com)
- **Problem-Based Learning**: Summative assessment uses realistic client scenario
- **Collaborative Learning**: Group project requiring teamwork and shared responsibility
- **Reflective Practice**: Students analyze their own frustrating user experience

##### **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**
- **Multiple Means of Representation**: Visual aids, hands-on activities, digital tools
- **Multiple Means of Engagement**: Variety of activities from individual reflection to group work
- **Accessibility Focus**: Course content explicitly addresses designing for all abilities
- **Tool Flexibility**: Offers both analog (pen/paper) and digital prototyping options

##### **Practical Implementation Planning**
- **Detailed Timing**: Time allocations for each activity (15-20 min, 10-15 min, etc.)
- **Resource Management**: Clear supply lists and technology requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Contingency plan for technology failures with alternative approaches
- **Scaffolded Activities**: Logical flow from introduction â†’ practice â†’ application â†’ reflection

##### **Standards Alignment**
- **ABET Criteria Integration**: Maps course objectives to accreditation standards
- **General Education Alignment**: Connects to broader institutional learning goals
- **Professional Relevance**: Ties learning to real-world software development practices

##### **Multimodal Learning Design**
- **Visual Learning**: Interface examples and design critiques
- **Kinesthetic Learning**: Hands-on prototyping and manipulation activities
- **Collaborative Learning**: Group discussions and team projects
- **Individual Reflection**: Personal analysis of design experiences
