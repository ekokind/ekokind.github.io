ARTS HERE! "Soon-ish" might be codeword for "its taken almost three years" but its up! Feel free to go check it out! 

Other miscellaneous updates: 
- Currently on the post-graduate job search, and I know the right job will turn up! 
- Working on a Discord bot to automate an activity my Dragon*Con group started last year, "Hurty Tummy DQ Blizzy Bingo" its been going okay and I am really excited to start adding functionality for it and testing it out with my group so that we don't have to keep track of a piece of paper this coming convention!
