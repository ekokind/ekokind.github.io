While recruiting for my most recent study ((which you can check out here))[_pages/participate.md], I reached out to Adam from Adam Learns Live, who is an established streamer on Twitch focusing on software and game development edutainment streams and, most recently focusing on developing his own indie game Skeleseller! When reaching out to Adam, he suggested an on-stream interview about my PhD journey and my research; how could I say no? 

We talked a lot about mentorship and how my personal journey to graduate school wasn't the most rosey, but I ended up in a place where I think I needed to be with my interests in live streaming research and beliefs that everyone needs access to an education, even if it is not in a formal classroom. Being able to showcase the work I have done in a casual, non-critical setting, was awesome and I felt like my work reached a broader more general audience in a way that was impactful. 

[I highly encourage everyone to check out Adam's streams on Twitch; they are as entertaining as they are informative!](https://www.twitch.tv/adamlearnslive)
