Ice Cream, Skybridges, and Peirogi, oh my! 

CSCW 2023 concluded a years-long project with my co-author and labmate Makayla Moster on breakout room use and student and professor opinions on fully remote classes in the COVID and post-COIVD era. We received some great feedback and personal anecdotes on the strategies that worked for others in attendance to make fully remote classes less dreadful. Some of my favourite publications from this round of CSCW are: 

“Oh yes! over-preparing for meetings is my jam :)”: The Gendered Experiences of System Administrators
Mannat Kaur, Harshini Sri Ramulu, Yasemin Acar, and Tobias Fiebig

Supporting Co-Regulation and Motivation In Learning Programming In Online Classrooms
Lahari Goswami, Alexandre Senges, Thibault Estier, and Mauro Cherubini

Hate Raids on Twitch: Echoes of the Past, New Modalities, and Implications for Platform Governance
Catherine Han, Joseph Seering, Deepak Kumar, Jeff Hancock, and Zakir Durumeric

I also had the pleasure of attending the Diversity and Inclusion lunch! 

Outside of the conference, we were able to explore Minneapolis through the network of elevated and enclosed sky bridges throughout the city. Our favorite spot to co-work outside the conference was Gray Fox Coffee in the Deluxe Plaza Atrium. Even though it was frigid outside, the atrium was warm and bright (the masala chai helped too). The hours spent coworking here paid off for Makayala and I with our upcoming publications at the 2024 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition in Portland. 

No trip would be complete without an ice cream stop and hoofing it to Bebe Zito was it! 

Finally, we ended the conference with dinner at Kramarczuk's Sausage Co. and a long walk back to the hotel along downtowns Nicollet Mall.
