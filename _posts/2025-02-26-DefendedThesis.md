I am thrilled to share that I have successfully defended my PhD thesis "Exploring the Pedagogical Impact of Software Development Live Streams: Informal Learning Opportunities for Software and Game Developers"! 

This was experience was both challenging and rewarding, and I couldn't have done it without the incredible support system around me. To everyone who attended, your presence meant the world to me. A heartfelt thank you to my advisor, Dr. Paige Rodeghero, who guided me through this journey with patience and wisdom, and to my incredible committee members: Dr. Kelly Caine, Dr. D. Matthew Boyer, and Dr. Emma Dixon. Your thoughtful questions and insights have made my research stronger and me a better researcher. 


I'm also endlessly grateful to the participants in my studies who shared their experiences, the students who took part in my live streaming course, and my family and friends who provided emotional support through late nights and moments of doubt. This milestone isn't just mine - it belongs to everyone who helped me along the way. Now, on to new adventures, who is hiring!?
