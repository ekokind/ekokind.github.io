ASEE 2024 was my first education-focused conference and, wow, what a group of the most compassionate, insightful, and fun people! Clemson having such a presence was a super cool experience that I wish could happen at every conference.

Having dedicated poster sessions really made a difference from other conferences that I have been to. Almost two hours of feedback, insight, and discussion with others interested in your work is not only motivational but, I think, better than any 5 minutes of questioning at the end of a presentation. Check out [my poster on viewer and streamer interactions](theme/pdfs/ASEE_2024_Content Analysis.pptx.pdf), as well as the [full paper here](https://ella.dev/theme/pdfs/2024_ASEE_Stream-Content-Analysis.pdf), and if you want to check out Makayla Moster and I's [joint paper on first generation women in graduate computing degrees](theme/pdfs/2024_ASEE_compiling-resilience-a-study-on-first-generation-women-pursuing-computing-degrees.pdf).

Outside of the conference, Portland was a wonderful and weird city with so much public transport, the best donuts (mochi donuts, ftw), brews, food, and weather that I could have asked for. Running from the conference to Powells or to get in line at Voodoo couldn't be beaten, and neither could going to the flagship restaurant for a cookbook that I own, Kyatcha! I could also have spent three whole days in the botanical gardens.
