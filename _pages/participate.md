# Are you interested in participating in my research related to software and game development? Look no further! 

Currently, I am looking to recruit participants who have watched and/or participated through chat features in a software or game development live stream in the last 90 days (three months). 

This is a Clemson Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved research study about viewership habits and the phenomena surrounding live streamed development content.

Why am I researching live streaming, specifically software and game development? 
* I believe that education is not tied to a degree or piece of paper; we continue to learn even when not in a classroom setting! I want to explore live streaming as a learning modality for both streamers and viewers and expand our knowledge around the opportunities (and challenges) that arise in a non-traditional education setting. I also believe that software engineering and computer science education is a collaborative effort; why else do we see so many flourishing developer communities? 

Why should you participate?
* Provides personal insights like benefits, challenges, and motivations for live streaming viewership habits
* Helps build an argument that live streaming could be used as an educational tool
* Builds legitimacy around a life-long learning practice
* Helps academics and researchers understand where formal educational systems might be letting students down (or where they are excelling!)

## Are you interested in participating in a short survey on your live streaming viewership experiences?
